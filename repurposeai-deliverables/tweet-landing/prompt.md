```
1/ I used to spend 6 hours repurposing every YouTube video.

Now I spend 10 minutes.

Here's the tool that changed everything:

2/ The problem: Your YouTube video takes 4 hours to make.

That same video could be 20 pieces of content.

But who has time to:
- Cut clips
- Write threads  
- Design carousels
- Draft newsletters

Not me. And probably not you.

3/ The solution: @RepurposeAI

You upload a video (or paste a YouTube link).

AI watches it, understands it, and generates:

• Twitter threads
• LinkedIn posts
• TikTok clips with captions
• Instagram carousels
• Newsletter drafts
• Blog posts

4/ The best part?

Each piece is NATIVE to its platform.

Not cross-posted garbage.

Actual platform-optimized content that performs.

5/ 12,000+ creators are using it.

Average time saved: 47 hours/month.
