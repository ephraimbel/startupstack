## Email Sequence Structure

### Email #1: The Math Behind Content Multiplication
**Send**: Day 0 (immediately after lead magnet download)
**Subject**: "The math behind 10x content output"  
**Preview**: "Why top creators seem to be everywhere"
**From**: "Sarah from RepurposeAI"

**Purpose**: Establish credibility and hint at solution

**Email Body**:

**Opening Hook**: 
"I used to spend 6 hours turning one YouTube video into social content. The clips, the threads, the carousels—it felt like a second full-time job."

**Main Content**:
"Then I did the math:

• 1 YouTube video = 4 hours to create
• Manual repurposing = 6 hours additional  
• Total: 10 hours for maybe 5 platforms

Meanwhile, creators with bigger teams were everywhere. Same video, 20+ pieces of content, all native to each platform.

The difference wasn't talent. It was systems."

**Value Promise**:
"Over the next few emails, I'm going to share the exact system that lets solo creators compete with teams of 10. No BS, just the framework that's working right now."

**Social Proof**:
"This is the same approach used by creators like [names] who've grown from 10K to 100K+ followers in months."

**CTA**:
"Tomorrow, I'll break down the exact 'Content Multiplication Framework' step by step."

**P.S.**:
"If you're curious about automating this entire process, reply and I'll send you early access to something we're building."

### Email #2: The Framework Reveal
**Send**: Day 2  
**Subject**: "The Content Multiplication Framework"
**Preview**: "Step-by-step breakdown inside"

**Purpose**: Deliver core educational value that builds trust

**Email Body**:

**Opening**: 
"As promised, here's the framework that changes everything."

**Main Content - The Framework**:
"**The Content Multiplication Framework:**

**Layer 1: The Source**
Start with ONE piece of long-form content. YouTube video, podcast, livestream. This is your content asset.

**Layer 2: The Extraction**  
Pull out:
- 3-5 standalone insights (→ tweets, LinkedIn posts)
- 2-3 story moments (→ short-form video clips)
- 1 structured breakdown (→ thread, carousel)
- Key quotes (→ quote graphics)
- Full narrative (→ newsletter, blog)

**Layer 3: Platform Optimization**
Each extraction gets reformatted NATIVE to its platform:
- Twitter: Hook-driven, punchy, use line breaks
- LinkedIn: Professional angle, longer form
- TikTok: Fast hook, visual, trending sounds
- Instagram: Visual-first, carousel format

**Layer 4: The Schedule**  
Drip content throughout the week. Your one video feeds 7 days of content."

**Bridge to Solution**:
"This framework turns 1 video into 20+ pieces of content. But manually, it still takes 3-4 hours.

That's where the magic happens..."

**CTA Setup**:
"In the next email, I'll show you how to compress those 3-4 hours into 10 minutes."

**P.S.**: 
"Save this email. Seriously. It's the foundation of everything that comes next."

90 days ago, he had 2,000 Twitter followers and posted maybe twice a week."

**Week 1:** Uploaded his first video. Got 12 pieces of content. Posted consistently for the first time ever.

**Week 4:** Twitter engagement up 340%. LinkedIn posts getting 10K+ impressions.

**CTA**:
"Your content deserves to be everywhere too."

**CTA Button**: "Start Your Free Trial"
