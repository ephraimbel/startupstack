## Interview Best Practices

### Do:
- **Listen 80%, talk 20%**: Let them tell their story
- **Ask "why" and "tell me more"** frequently
- **Note emotional language** (frustrated, excited, exhausted)  
- **Ask for specific examples**, not hypotheticals
- **Record if possible** so you can be present in conversation
- **Thank them genuinely** for their time and insights

### Don't:
- **Pitch your solution** before understanding their problem
- **Lead the witness** with loaded questions
- **Argue with feedback** or get defensive
- **Ask yes/no questions** when open-ended would be better
- **Rush through** - give them time to think
- **Make promises** about features or pricing
