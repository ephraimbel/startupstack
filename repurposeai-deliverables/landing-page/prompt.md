### Problem Section

1. ⏰ **Hours Lost to Reformatting** - Manual repurposing takes 4-6 hours per video
2. 📉 **Platforms You're Ignoring** - Should be on LinkedIn, TikTok, Twitter but no time
3. 💰 **Hiring Is Expensive** - Good editor costs $2-5K/month, unrealistic when growing
4. ⚡ **Content Dies After Upload** - Best insights buried in long videos vs reaching new audiences
