## Overview
Create a high-converting landing page for Clippie, the AI viral clip generator that finds and formats the best moments from long-form videos into ready-to-post shorts.

## Target Audience & Context
- **Primary**: YouTubers, podcasters, Twitch streamers (10K-500K subscribers) producing weekly content
- **Pain**: Spending 3-5 hours manually scrubbing footage to find clip-worthy moments, or giving up entirely
- **Goal**: Get them to try the free tier (60 minutes included, no credit card)

## Landing Page Structure & Copy

### Hero Section
**Headline**: "Turn your long videos into viral shorts"
**Subheadline**: "AI finds your best moments and creates ready-to-post clips with captions. Upload once, clip forever."
**Primary CTA**: "Try Free — 60 Minutes Included"
**Secondary CTA**: "Watch demo (2 min) →"
**Social Proof**: "Join 12,000+ creators saving 4+ hours per video"

**Hero Visual**: Split screen showing single YouTube video transforming into multiple vertical clips with captions. Animated to show AI finding moments with sparkle effects.

### Problem Section
**Headline**: "Your best content is trapped in hour-long videos"

**Pain Points** (with icons):
1. **⏰ You're leaving views on the table** - "Every podcast and stream has 10+ viral moments. But who has 4 hours to find them? Those views are going to creators who clip."

2. **📈 Manual clipping doesn't scale** - "You tried scrubbing through footage. It's mind-numbing. You hire an editor for $500/month. They quit. You're back to square one."

3. **🎯 Short-form is non-negotiable now** - "TikTok, Shorts, Reels—3 billion daily users. If you're not there, you're invisible to half your potential audience."

4. **💀 Content dies after upload** - "Your best insights get buried in long videos instead of reaching new audiences as clips."

**Stat Callout**: "90% of content value is left untapped by creators who don't clip" - Creator Economy Report 2024
