# Clippie Pricing Strategy - AI Generation Prompt

## Overview
Create a comprehensive pricing strategy for Clippie, the AI viral clip generator, including tier structure, pricing psychology, monetization optimization, and competitive positioning.

## Product Context
- **Core Value**: AI finds viral moments in videos and creates ready-to-post clips with captions
- **Target Market**: YouTubers, podcasters, streamers (10K-500K subscribers) producing weekly content
- **Cost Structure**: Video processing has real per-minute costs (OpenAI, compute, storage)
- **Competitive Landscape**: Opus Clip ($19-49), Munch ($49-116), Vidyo.ai ($29-49)

## Pricing Model Rationale

### Usage-Based with Tier Floors
**Why This Model**:
- Video processing has real costs per minute - usage-based feels fair
- Creators understand paying for what they use (similar to editing software)
- Free tier allows experience of the "magic" before commitment
- Usage caps prevent runaway costs while allowing power users to scale
- Predictable revenue with natural upgrade paths

### Value-Based Pricing Psychology
**Core Insight**: Creators currently spend 3-5 hours manually finding clips OR pay $500-2K/month for editors
**Value Proposition**: Save 4+ hours per video while improving clip quality
**Pricing Anchor**: Time savings (20+ hours/month) + editor replacement value

## Tier Structure & Pricing

## Pricing Optimization Strategy

### Free Tier Strategy
**Generous Value with Strategic Limits**:
- 60 minutes = enough to process 1-2 videos and see clear value
- 5 clips per video = demonstrates quality but not enough for full strategy
- Watermark creates viral marketing while motivating upgrades
- No credit card = removes friction for trial

**Conversion Triggers**:
- Hit monthly limit (most powerful upgrade motivator)
- Want to remove watermark for professional content
- Need speaker detection for podcast clips
- Require more clips per video for comprehensive strategy

### Creator Tier Psychology
**Perfect Anchor Pricing**:
- $29 matches competitor pricing (Opus Clip, Vidyo.ai)
- $1/day framing = coffee/snack cost for massive time savings
- 10 hours = ~20-40 videos for weekly creators (room to grow)
- Feature set solves 90% of creator needs

**Upgrade Triggers to Pro**:
- Processing more than 10 hours (natural usage growth)
- Want 4K export for premium content
- Need analytics to optimize clip strategy

### Pro Tier Value Communication
**Professional Creator Positioning**:
- $79 = 1-2 hours of creator time for monthly tool access
- 50 hours = daily content creators with buffer room

- 4K export positions as premium professional tool

### Agency Tier B2B Value
**Service Business Economics**:
- $199 serves 10-20 clients = $10-20/client/month
- White-label enables agencies to mark up service significantly
- Team features essential for service businesses
- API access allows custom integrations for large clients

## Annual Discount Strategy
**17% Discount (2 Months Free)**:
- Creator: $24/month × 12 = $288 (vs $348 monthly)
- Pro: $66/month × 12 = $792 (vs $948 monthly)  
- Agency: $166/month × 12 = $1,992 (vs $2,388 monthly)

**Psychology**: 2 months free is clear, understandable value that improves cash flow
