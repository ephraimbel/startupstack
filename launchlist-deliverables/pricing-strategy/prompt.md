# LaunchList Pricing Strategy - AI Generation Prompt

## Overview
Create a comprehensive pricing strategy for LaunchList, the viral waitlist platform, including tier structure, validation-focused pricing psychology, and competitive positioning in the pre-launch tools market.

## Product Context
- **Core Value**: Viral waitlist platform that turns signups into marketers through referral mechanics and engagement
- **Target Market**: Founders, indie hackers, product managers launching products who need pre-launch momentum and validation
- **Cost Structure**: Email delivery, hosting, storage for customizations, minimal incremental costs per signup
- **Competitive Landscape**: LaunchRock (free-$49), KickoffLabs ($49-199), Viral Loops ($49-499), DIY solutions

## Pricing Model Rationale

### Freemium with Signup Limits
**Why This Model**:
- Founders need free tier to validate ideas—charging before validation kills adoption
- Signup-based pricing aligns with value delivered (more signups = more value)
- Free tier creates viral growth through branding on shared pages
- Natural upgrade path as launches grow successful

### Validation-First Pricing Psychology
**Core Insight**: Founders at idea stage have $0 budget but will pay once they see traction
**Value Proposition**: Free validation → paid scaling → successful launch
**Pricing Anchor**: Engineering time savings (2-4 weeks of dev work vs 5 minutes)
