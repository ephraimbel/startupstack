# LaunchList Landing Page - AI Generation Prompt

## Overview
Create a high-converting landing page for LaunchList, the viral waitlist platform that helps founders create beautiful pre-launch pages with built-in referral mechanics and engagement tools.

## Target Audience & Context
- **Primary**: Founders, indie hackers, product managers launching new products who want pre-launch momentum
- **Pain**: Most waitlists collect emails and do nothing, no virality, no engagement, launch day arrives with lukewarm lists
- **Goal**: Get them to try the free tier (500 signups, no credit card required)

## Landing Page Structure & Copy

### Hero Section
**Headline**: "Waitlists that grow themselves"
**Subheadline**: "Beautiful pre-launch pages with built-in referral mechanics. Turn every signup into a marketer. Launch with thousands of warm leads."
**Primary CTA**: "Create Free Waitlist"
**Secondary CTA**: "See examples →"
**Social Proof**: "Join founders who've collected 1M+ pre-launch signups"

**Hero Visual**: Split screen showing boring old Mailchimp form vs. beautiful LaunchList page with referral leaderboard and position counter. Animated viral growth visualization.

### Problem Section
**Headline**: "Your waitlist is probably broken"

**Pain Points** (with icons):
1. **📧 Signups and then... silence** - "People join your waitlist and forget you exist. By launch day, they don't remember signing up. Zero engagement, zero excitement."

2. **🔗 No virality without engineering** - "Building referral tracking takes weeks. You know it works—Harry's got 100K signups—but you don't have time to build it yourself."

3. **😴 Boring pages lose signups** - "Your product is innovative but your waitlist page looks like a 2015 Mailchimp form. First impressions matter. People bounce."

4. **📊 No idea what's working** - "Is your conversion rate good? Who are your top referrers? How many will actually show up on launch day? You're flying blind."

**Stat Callout**: "Harry's collected 100,000+ signups before launch using referral waitlists" - Harvard Business Review

### FAQ
1. **How does the referral system work?** - "Each signup gets a unique link. When someone signs up through that link, both people move up the waitlist. You can also set reward tiers—like early access at 5 referrals, discount at 10, swag at 25."

3. **How do I prevent fake signups and referrals?** - "We detect duplicate emails, disposable email domains, and suspicious referral patterns. Growth plans include advanced fraud detection."

4. **Can I export my signups?** - "Absolutely. Export to CSV anytime, or integrate directly with Mailchimp, ConvertKit, and 50+ tools via Zapier."

5. **What happens on launch day?** - "You can send a launch announcement to your entire list with one click. We're also building Product Hunt integration to auto-notify signups when you launch."

6. **Is there really a free plan?** - "Yes—500 signups, forever free. Enough to validate your idea. When you're ready to scale, upgrade. We grow when you grow."
