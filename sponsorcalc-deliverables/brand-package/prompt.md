## Brand Voice & Messaging

### Tone of Voice
Confident and supportive. Like a savvy friend who worked in the industry and now has your back.

### Do's:
- Emphasize empowerment ("You're worth more than you think")
- Use money language comfortably ("Get paid", "rates", "revenue")
- Reference specific improvements ("20% higher rates")
- Validate creator frustrations with brands
- Be direct about value

### Don'ts:
- Don't be preachy about money
- Don't talk down to creators
- Don't use corporate jargon
- Don't promise specific dollar amounts (too variable)
- Don't bash brands (creators need them)

### Key Messages
1. "Know your worth."
2. "Data beats guesswork."
3. "Stop accepting whatever brands offer."
4. "Professional rates, professional rate cards."
5. "The same data brands have—now in your hands."

### Elevator Pitches
- **10 seconds**: "SponsorCalc tells creators exactly what to charge brands—backed by data, not guesswork."
- **30 seconds**: "Creators leave thousands on the table because they don't know market rates. SponsorCalc analyzes your engagement, audience, and niche to generate professional rate cards with tiered pricing. Stop guessing, start knowing."
