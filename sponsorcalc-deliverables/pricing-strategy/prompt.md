# SponsorCalc - Pricing Strategy

Develop a comprehensive pricing strategy for SponsorCalc that maximizes revenue while ensuring strong user adoption and retention.

## Pricing Model Overview
**Model**: Freemium with feature gates
**Rationale**: Free basic rate calculation hooks creators. Paid unlocks professional features (PDF export, negotiation support, benchmarks). Low cost-to-serve means generous free tier is sustainable.

## Pricing Psychology & Strategy

### Annual Discount Structure
- **20% discount** on annual plans (equivalent to 2.4 months free)
- Improves cash flow and reduces churn
- Positions annual as "smart choice"

### Pricing Anchoring
- **Creator at $19** is the anchor price—feels reasonable for business expense
- **Pro at $49** uses contrast effect to make Creator feel affordable while capturing power users
- **Agency at $99** is for self-selection by businesses that need it

### Free Tier Strategy
**Purpose**: Growth engine and product validation
- Generous enough to provide real value (proves the concept works)
- Limited enough to create upgrade pressure (PDF export paywall)
- Creates word-of-mouth through watermarked sharing

**Conversion Target**: 10-15% free-to-paid conversion rate

### ROI Positioning
- **$19/month pays for itself** with a single 20% rate increase on one deal
- Position as ROI, not cost: "Investment in your creator business"
- Show concrete value: "Creators increase rates by $200-400/deal on average"

## Pricing Elasticity Analysis

### Price Sensitivity by Segment
1. **Micro-creators (10K-50K followers)**:
   - High price sensitivity
   - Free tier crucial for adoption
   - Creator plan ($19) is ceiling for most

2. **Mid-tier creators (50K-250K followers)**:
   - Moderate price sensitivity
   - Strong adoption of Creator and Pro plans
   - Value professional features

3. **Top-tier creators (250K+ followers)**:
   - Low price sensitivity
   - Willing to pay for Pro/Agency features
   - Focus on time-saving and professionalism

### Competitive Pricing Analysis
- **Social Bluebook**: $9.99/month Pro (underpriced, feature-limited)
- **FYPM**: Free (not sustainable long-term)
- **Creator Calculator**: Free (no monetization model)
- **Aspire**: Enterprise (different market)

**Positioning**: Premium pricing justified by superior features and professional output.

### Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) Targets

- **Month 6**: $12K MRR (500 paying customers, $24 ARPU)
- **Month 12**: $50K MRR (2000+ paying customers, $25 ARPU)

- **Free to paid conversion**: 10-15%
- **Plan distribution**: 60% Creator, 30% Pro, 10% Agency

3. **Annual discount**: Test 15% vs 20% vs 25% off
4. **Feature gates**: Which features drive most upgrades

### Success Metrics

## Pricing Communication Strategy

### Website Messaging
- Lead with free tier to reduce friction
- Emphasize ROI: "Pays for itself with one better deal"
- Show feature progression clearly
- Include "Most Popular" badge on Creator plan

### Upgrade Prompts
- **PDF Export Paywall**: "Upgrade to send professional rate cards to brands"
- **Platform Limit**: "Connect all your platforms to see complete earning potential"
- **Benchmarks**: "See how your rates compare to similar creators"

### Objection Handling
- **"Too expensive"**: Show ROI calculator based on rate improvements
- **"Why not free?"**: Explain value of professional features
- **"Uncertain about value"**: Offer extended free trial or money-back guarantee

## Pricing Evolution Roadmap
