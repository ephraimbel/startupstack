  "brand_story": "RepurposeAI was born from a creator's frustration. After spending 4 hours filming a YouTube video, the thought of manually cutting clips for TikTok, writing a Twitter thread, designing Instagram carousels, and drafting a newsletter felt exhausting. Most creators know their long-form content is a goldmine—but mining it takes more time than creating it.\n\nWe built RepurposeAI to be the tireless content assistant every creator deserves. Drop in your video, and watch as AI transforms it into a week's worth of platform-perfect content. No more choosing between quality and quantity. No more letting great ideas die on one platform. Your content deserves to work as hard as you do.",
