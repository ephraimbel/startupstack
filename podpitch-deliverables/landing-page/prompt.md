## Overview
Create a high-converting landing page for PodPitch, the AI-powered podcast outreach platform that helps founders get booked on relevant podcasts through intelligent show discovery, personalized pitches, and complete pipeline management.

## Target Audience & Context
- **Primary**: Founders, consultants, B2B executives seeking to build authority and reach target customers
- **Pain**: Podcast guesting works but finding shows, writing personalized pitches, and managing outreach is broken
- **Goal**: Get them to try the free tier (5 AI-generated pitches, no credit card required)

## Landing Page Structure & Copy

### Hero Section
**Headline**: "Get booked on podcasts that reach your customers"
**Subheadline**: "50K+ podcasts. AI-personalized pitches. Full pipeline management. Book appearances that build authority—without hiring an agency."
**Primary CTA**: "Start Free — 5 Pitches Included"
**Secondary CTA**: "See how it works →"
**Social Proof**: "Join founders booking 5-10 podcasts per month"

**Hero Visual**: Professional dashboard showing podcast database search results with AI-generated pitch preview and pipeline kanban view. Clean, data-forward design.

### Problem Section
**Headline**: "Podcast guesting works. The process doesn't."

**Pain Points** (with icons):
1. **🔍 Finding shows is a full-time job** - "Hours of Googling, scrolling Apple Podcasts, and checking if they even take guests. You've got a company to run."

2. **📧 Generic pitches get ignored** - "Hosts receive 50+ pitches weekly. Templated emails go straight to trash. Personalization takes 20+ minutes per show."

3. **📈 Follow-ups fall through the cracks** - "You pitch 10 shows, get busy, forget to follow up. 80% of bookings come from follow-ups. Opportunities lost."

4. **💸 Agencies cost a fortune** - "Professional PR agencies charge $2-5K/month. That's $30K+ annually for what you could do yourself with the right tools."

**Stat Callout**: "72% of B2B buyers have purchased after hearing a founder on a podcast" - Podcast Industry Report 2024

### Solution Section
**Headline**: "Professional podcast PR. Do it yourself."
**Subheadline**: "Everything you need to run agency-level podcast outreach campaigns from your desk."

**Key Features** (with icons):
1. **📊 50K+ Podcast Database** - "Search by topic, audience size, and guest acceptance rate. Find shows your customers actually listen to."

4. **🔄 Pipeline Management** - "Track every pitch from draft to booked. Never lose track of a warm lead again."
