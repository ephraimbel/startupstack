#### Example Newsletter Content:
```
Subject: Creator Legal Tip: Never agree to "unlimited revisions"

Hey [First Name],

This week's creator legal tip could save you hours of unpaid work:

🚨 NEVER AGREE TO "UNLIMITED REVISIONS"

Here's why: I talked to a creator last week who spent 20 hours on "small tweaks" for a $500 brand deal. That's $25/hour - below minimum wage.

✅ Instead, try this language:
"This agreement includes 3 rounds of revisions. Additional revisions will be billed at $[X] per hour."

🎯 This Week's Success Story:
Ashley used this exact clause and got paid an extra $400 when a brand requested 6 revision rounds. The brand didn't even argue - they just paid.

P.S. If you're tired of revision chaos, our Creator plan includes revision-limit templates for every deal type. [Learn more]
